You are given an array A containing N integers. The special product of each ith integer in this array is defined as the product of the following:

 

LeftSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] and (i>j). If multiple A[j]'s are present in multiple positions, the LeftSpecialValue is the maximum value of j.
RightSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] and (j>i). If multiple A[j]'s are present in multiple positions, the RightSpecialValue is the minimum value of j.
Write a program to find the maximum special product of any integer in the array.

 

Input format : first line contains the size of the array. Next line contains n integers, the elements of the array.

 

Output format : print a single integer, the maximu special product

 

Note :  You may use inbuild data structure from c++ libraries for implementation

 

Sample test case : 

Input : 

4 

1 4 3 4

Output : 3

 

Explanation : 

For A[2] = 3, LeftSpecialValue is 1 and RightSpecialValue is 3. So, the ans is 1*3 = 3.
