Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

-> push(x) – Push element x onto stack.

-> pop() – Removes the element on top of the stack.

-> top() – Get the top element.

-> getmin() – Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

Note that all the operations have to be constant time operations.

 

In case of getmin() when stack is empty, return -1. In case of pop() when stack is empty, do nothing. In case of top() when stack is empty, return -1.

 

Input format : first line is the integer, the number of queries to be processed. Next Q lines contains first word as the operation to be performed and when the operation to be performed is a push, and additional integer x to be pushed into the stack is given.

Output format :  print your answer on different lines.
